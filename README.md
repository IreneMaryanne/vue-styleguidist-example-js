# vue-simple-starter

Extremely simple Vue starter that I use for my teaching examples. Its only dependency is Poi (and Sass for scss) and all its features, including using JSX.

It has already 2 commands:

* `npm start`: runs the app in a dev-server with hot reloading
* `npm build`: builds the app in production mode and create bundles
